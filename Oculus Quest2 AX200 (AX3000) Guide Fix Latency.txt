# GUIDE to get Quest2 working with HotSpot of Intel AX200 PCIe and Win10 (Tested and working with 3 different pc hardware with TP-LINK AX3000)
# By AdrenSnyder :-)
# 
# This script enable wireless scan, enable hotspot (you have to previously configure it) and disable scan to reduce latency
#
# USAGE: After you have done all the next things (-->) needed to get it work you only need to:
# 1) Start the link to the batch file (admin priviledge required)
# 2) Connect 1 mobile phone to HotSpot
# 3) Connect Quest2. Now you should connect at 600/1200mbps with 1-5ms latency (ping to ip of the quest2. Not the VD latency)
#
# YOU HAVE TO DO THIS NEXT THINGS ONLY ONE TIME TO ADAPT THE SCRIPT TO YOUR HARDWARE AND AUTORIZE POWERSHELL TO START IT
#
# --> Copy this entire pastebin to a file and name it Start_HotSpot_Quest2.ps1
#
# --> Download and install last IT drivers from intel:
# https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/30113/Intel-PROSet-Wireless-Software-and-Drivers-for-IT-Admins
#
# --> I do some mods in the Advanced driver section of device manager. 
# - Block global scan: Always
# - Fat channel incompatible: Enabled
# - Increase throughput: Enabled
# - Energy saving: no SMPS
# - Mixed mode: CTS-to-self enabled
#
# --> Configure the HotSpot with SSID, password and 5Ghz channel
#
# --> Start a powershell with admin priviledges one time to enable script execution. Execute this commands:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
# Set-executionpolicy -Scope currentuser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
#
# --> NOTE: If it give a warning when you start the script you have to unblock the file
# Unblock-File Start_HotSpot_Quest2.ps1
# 
# --> Create a batch (Ex. Start_HotSpot_Quest2.bat) with inside:
# powershell ./Start_HotSpot_Quest2.ps1
#
# --> Create a link to the batch file and give it Admin Rights.
# 
# --> IMPORTANT NOTE: In the part "Enable Scan" and "Disable Scan" you have to change "Wi-fi" with your Wireless Adapter Name to get script work
#
# END GUIDE

# Declare variable for control the HotSpot
$connectionProfile = [Windows.Networking.Connectivity.NetworkInformation,Windows.Networking.Connectivity,ContentType=WindowsRuntime]::GetInternetConnectionProfile()
$tetheringManager = [Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.NetworkOperatorTetheringManager,Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators,ContentType=WindowsRuntime]::CreateFromConnectionProfile($connectionProfile)

# Enable Scan (need it to enable HotSpot)
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=yes interface="Wi-Fi"

# Start Mobile Hotspot
$tetheringManager.StartTetheringAsync()
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2

# Disable Scan (need it to remove latency when Windows do a scheduled network scan)
netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=no interface="Wi-Fi"
